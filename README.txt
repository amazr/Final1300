HELLO!
This is going to be a brief overview/guide for Completely Useful Programming (CUP)
This language is currently interpreted by C++!

HOW TO RUN:
	Step 1: Save your file in the form of "fileName.cup"
	Step 2: Compile and run Language.cpp
	Step 3: Input your amazing and perfectly done CUP codes file name WITH the extension when prompted!
	Sted 4: Now get on with it!

BASIC SYNTAX RULES:
	There is no end of line character. To make a distinction between lines, simply hit enter and start typing on the next line!
	Whitespace will be completely ignored EXCEPT inside string literals
	When appending a value to a string literal wrap the variable name in ':'  EXAMPLE -> display "I have " :numDogs: " dogs" ->I have 4 dogs
	
DECLARING A VARIABLE: 
	data_type var_name = var_value
	currently a variable name can be whatever you'd like
	if there is an error an exception with the line number will be thrown

DISPLAYING TO TERMINAL:
	display: "hello world"
	Any '.' (period) outside of quotation marks will end the line. Equivalent to 'endl' or '\n'
	If display is called but there is no argument a warning will be thrown but your code will still be interpreted

CURRENT KEYWORDS:
int -> integer datatype declaration
display -> command for printing to terminal (see displaying to terminal section)


Current Supported Datatypes:
int (integer)

Planned Supported Datatypes:
dec (aka double/float)
chr (character/char)
str (string)
bol (boolean)

Currently Supported Operators:
=, :var: (to append to literal), 

Planned Supported Operators: 
+, -, /, *, %, ++, +=, --, 

Currently Support Conditional:
:(

Planned Supported Condition:
if, and, or, elif, el, is, isnt

Currently Supported Loops:
:(

Planned Supported Loops:
loop: from star-end: iterator var
loop: true : iterator var
